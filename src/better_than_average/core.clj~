;; There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
;; But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.
;; You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!
;; Return true if you're better, else false!
;; Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. Do not forget them when calculating the average score!
